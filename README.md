### Part 1: Implementing your first function:

1. Open the file **Main.java** and implement the **isValidEmailAddress** function, that takes as input a String, and it
   returns **true** if is a valid email address or **false** otherwise.

### Advance Challenge: implement a second function from scratch

1. Implement a second function that validates a telephone number including a valid country code.

   ***Hint***: Read carefully the written code on the **isValidEmailAddress** and copy and paste this block and change
   the name to something meaningful.
